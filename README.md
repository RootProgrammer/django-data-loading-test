### Migrate the database

- Check the [data flow diagrams](https://prnt.sc/u93yw2). You need to apply this data flow for listing products on the table and insert new products into the database.  

#### Data List: 4

- Make a list of view page of Products table data the [same as](https://prntscr.com/u944u8)                              (2)
- Make a data summary of the products [same as](https://prntscr.com/u945c2)                                              (1)  
- Make data pagination of products [same as](https://prntscr.com/u945nv)                                                 (1)

#### Data Filter: 7

#### Create Product:  5

- (Click on Product and then Create Product from Left sidebar) this page has been designed  with vuejs and reactjs you will find the code in the directory: `src/template/assets/js/components/CreateProduct.vue?js` (based on which version you downloaded).  
- As we use variant permutation thats why we use js framework, if you don't have enough knowladge in vuejs / reactjs we suggest you to download the vue project because vue have all the code to send the data to backend (django). All you need is to change the post url to your newly created url and that's all.
- Insert data into products, product_variants, product_product_prices and  product_images while create a product ,check the [screenshot](https://prntscr.com/u94u5i)
  
#### Edit Product: 10  

- Data should be loaded as same as given data in the edit product page. And it can be updated
